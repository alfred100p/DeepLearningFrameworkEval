Evaluating based on data available as of 2024/09

### Considered Frameworks
Considering Popular Python Frameworks
* Tensorflow 2.x
   
* PyTorch
* Keras
* JAX

## Metrics and Definitions

### Purpose of Deep Learning Framework
* Abstraction and Simplification: Interfaces and Implementations ready to use out of the box
  * Predefined functions will check for prescence of X a popular layer and Y a recent layer which has proved to be useful, limiting scope to these 2 for brevity.
* Optimized Execution: Optimal Implementations of functions and Hardware Acceleration
  * Execution time: this will vary from function to function so created a notebook for use to evaluate such models. Will add any benchmarks found.
  * Hardware Acceleration: Presence of Support for hardware accelration
  * Distributed Training
* Up/Downstream Functionality: Any functionality besides training and inference
  * Presence of Data Ingestion
  * Presence of Pre-processing
  *
