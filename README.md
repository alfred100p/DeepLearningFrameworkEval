# DeepLearningFrameworkEval
Evaluation of Popular Deep Learning Frameworks

## Why
As a researcher, I utilised PyTorch due to its extensive use used in academia and implementations, and low-level optimizations were not the main focus of my research. Now, as an engineer, I'm interested in understanding what to use for future projects.

## What is a Deep Learning Framework
A deep learning framework is a software library or platform that provides tools, pre-built components, and an interface for designing, building, training, and deploying deep learning models. These frameworks simplify the process of implementing complex neural network architectures by handling the low-level details, such as tensor operations, gradient computation, and hardware acceleration, allowing developers and researchers to focus on designing and training models.
